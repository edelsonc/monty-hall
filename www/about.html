The Monty Hall problem is a well known puzzle in statistics. Based on
the show "Let's Make a Deal", the Monty Hall problem presents the
contestant with three identacle doors. They're told that two of the doors
hide goats, while the final doors has a car behind it. The contestant is then
prompted to select a door. One of the two remaining doors is 
then opened to reveal a goat. The contestant is then asked if they wish to
keep their door or switch to the remaining unopen door.
